          <h1>Surface Temperature Data Visualization</h1>
            <p class="subtitle"> This data was provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database <br> and is based on the publically avaliable GISTEMP data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies. <br> Please note that the dataset isn't fully complete, there are sections of missing data for certain years for certain countries. </p>

           <p> My goal is simply to make this information on climate change a little bit more accessible, I hope that anyone that comes across this will find it useful, thank you :]</p>
